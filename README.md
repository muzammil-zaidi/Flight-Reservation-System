# ✈️ Flight Reservation System (DSA Project)

A **console-based Flight Reservation System** developed in **C++** using core **Data Structures & Algorithms**.

---

## 📌 Overview
The system manages:
- Airports using hashing
- Flights using linked lists
- Route optimization using graphs and shortest path algorithms

---

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms Used
- **Hash Table** → Airport Management  
- **Singly Linked List** → Flight Management  
- **Graph (Adjacency Matrix)** → Route Optimization  
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** → Shortest Path  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Add, update, delete airports (Hashing)
- Add, update, delete, search flights
- Validate flight routes using airport data
- Find shortest route between airports
- Display flight connections & adjacency matrix
